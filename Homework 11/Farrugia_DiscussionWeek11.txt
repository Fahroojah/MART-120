What are the rules here? When/how can we use someone elseâ€™s work? When is it not okay? Do we need to create everything from scratch?  What are your thoughts on this?

	This is such a complex question. During my last attempt at finishing my major, we were all asked to write an 'artist bio'; basically we had to describe our artistic style,
our goals, and things that inspired us. My answer was that I'm not an artist; I'm a thief.

	One of the most amazing parts of the internet is that it is such an immensely collaborative enviornment, and it's origins directly represent an open source, shared stream of information and resources.

	I like to operate under the notion that most things are free to use unless expressly stated otherwise.
