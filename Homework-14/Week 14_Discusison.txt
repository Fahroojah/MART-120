How do you feel you have changed throughout the semester. How has your perception toward programming changed? For the better? For worse? (I hope not!) Did it stay the same? Are you curious to learn more?

	This course has been one of the most challenging and rewarding things I have done in a long time.Easily a highlight of 2020.
 Once upon I time I used to be much more fascinated with programming, but somewhere along the way
 life happened and my interest shifted. What I most enjoyed about this class is the challenge of being forced to think about logic of programming.
 It has been a really long time since I have used that part of the brain. It was also quite enjoyable to be able to create something and know
 exactly how it was made.
