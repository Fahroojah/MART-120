	 I struggle with this everytime I try to explain anything that is detailed, or requires some subelty or nuance. I have got into
some hotwater because my texts or emails were misconstrued. Texting has made communication so quick that I think so many of us have lost
the art of sending thoughtful, well constructed messages to each other. Letter writing was (still is?) an important skill. If you only 
have one chance and a limited amount of space to send message to friend, you're going to have to be very thoughtful about what you say
and how you say it. There are sometimes when I wish this trend would come back, and that it communication wasn't so fast and that
people didn't expect you to immediately reply. As someone who is quite introverted, the constant contact can be very tiring.
