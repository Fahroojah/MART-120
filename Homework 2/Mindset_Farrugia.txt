I scored a 35 on the Mindset quiz, which put me on the lowest level of the group that states 
"YOUR RESULTS SUGGEST A GROWTH MINDSET BUT WITH SOME FIXED IDEAS."

I'd say that this is fairly accurate. I contend that I view failure as a more of a negative than I should,
and that I often am apprehensive to start/try new things for fear of being unsuccessful.

It's really interesting because I can absolutely understand why failure should be viewed as a positive, but if
am really honest with myself I struggle to shake this instinctual feeling that it is "bad".
