	I watched this video years ago and appreciated the chance to review it once again. Randy is a truly inspiring individual and it is clear he has succeeded in persuing his childhood dreams. 
I really enjoyed his concept of the "head fake"; getting someone to learn something without them being aware that they are being taught. It is a simple concept on it's face but one that I imagine to be very difficult to master.
Another takeaway that I had after re-watching the video was how little I have pursued my personal childhood dreams. I've been struggling quite a bit in the last year or so to figure out what I truly want; what do I want to learn,
work towrads, accomplish in life, etc. What really is my motivation, and what is my goal? I've never been very talented at goal setting and that it something I am working to change everyday.

	Another quote from the video that really struck a chord with me was "Brick walls are there for a reason: they let us prove how badly we want things". This is very similar to a popular Stoic quote: "The obstacle is the way".
I have explored Stoic philosphy in the past and find that it has more and more relevance in my life the older I get and the more experience I obtain. On a personal note, I am quickly overwhelmed by challenges, to the point that the anxiety around
doing something new and potentialy failing becomes all consuming and crippling. Randy's lecture is a good reminder to not be afraid to challenges.
