	This week's discussion is all about your privacy and convenience.  We must decide what we are willing to share versus what we are unwilling to give to a company. 
With the growing number of data breaches out there, there is a new normal arising regarding our personal information. 
Are you okay with it? Are you worried about someone stealing your personal information? What do you do to protect yourself?

	I am so fascinated by this subject and I think it could be a great class / lecture at somepoint. I quickly scrolled through the discussions posted by other students, and while I think when asked directly,
most folks like to think that they are 'being safe' and using best practices, but the amount of data that is being collected (and sold!) is truly staggering, it is often done without our constent or us even being aware that
it is happening!

I personally do not act overtly cautious when browsing websites; sort of following the mentaility that if I'm not doing anything wrong, I've got nothing to hide. It might not be a position I'd recommend, and I very
much wish there was a (convenient) way for me to better protect who has access to my data. But I am so delighted to have things 'just work' as Apple famously said long ago; all of my email syncs to all of my gizmos, my 
watch can show me texts, my bike computers can load routes while I'm riding in Italy, I can travel internationally and my phone will suggest language apps and other travel tips. All of this convenience is bought
and paid for with my personal info and metadata. Being a man of modest means, this is still a trade I'm willing to make. I'd love for there to be an option to 'pay' for privacy; so that I get to keep all of my on-demand pocket convenience,
I pay a small tithe to the mega-corps, and they don't get to hoard piles of metadata about me. The real question is, how much is my personal information actually worth to these companies?
