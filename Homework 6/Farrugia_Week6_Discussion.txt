With the prevalence of social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, and others, how can we effectively integrate them with our work website to reach more viewers (in a business sense)?
One cannot replace the other, but maybe they can complement one another.

We have created necessary evils and have allowed mega-corporations to profit off of our data for too long. I think that until we are willing
to be protective of our personal information that Facebook/Google will continue to a requirement for business of all sizes.
