I am struggling to identify challenges that I have overcome. I know that this is a very poor answer, but everything that might come to mind
feels like a lame answer/challenge, or 'privledged' problem that I don't feel proud about sharing. Most, if not all of my challenges are internal problems, rather than
external ones. I didn't have to walk uphill both ways, in the snow to get to school.
