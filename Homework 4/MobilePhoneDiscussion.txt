	I have a love/hate relationship with my phone. I love that I have an immensely powerful mini-computer in my pocket at all times,
and that with it I have access to all of humanities collective knowledge. I hate that I use it for memes and looking at pictures of people
riding there bike. It is one of the most important/iconic inventions of our time and instead I'm glued to mindless, bite-sized fluff content
specificly created to sell more ad space.
