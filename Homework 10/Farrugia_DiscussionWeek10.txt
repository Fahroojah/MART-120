With the rise in gaming, there is a significant need for new types of artistry.  Is this something that interests you?  What are all the art forms found in gaming?  Is there one in particular that stands out to you? 

	I've been captivated my games for as long as I can remember. I think anyone who looks down or dismisses gaming as an unproductive use of time is woefully ignorant. I think there is true art not in just the creation
of the games themselves, but I think that gameplay can be artful. A good carpenter can fix your shelf, but an artisan woodwork can make your shelf something to be admired. I think the same is true for gaming, and to some 
extent I think that is what has driven the popularity of platforms like Twitch, which allows us to watch masters of their crafts do what they do the best.
I think games/gaming have such amazing potential to do some much net good for the world.
