Inspiration? Who or what has or still does inspire you?
Talk about what inspires you to create art, express yourself, and believe in yourself.


	I am continuously inspired by visinoaries and futurists. People who are able to look at the trends of today and see
how they are almost certain to shape our society in the future. Andrew Yang, Elon Musk, Tim Bernes-Lee and Bill Joy are all people who
inspireme.

	A quick note: I am very aware that my Alice project is incomplete. I really dove down a rabithole (pun intended) and ended up
sinking hours into trying to build something that was probably too ambitious for a first project. I've included where I got to and I'd 
love to figure out what step I am missing at somepoint in the future, but in the interest of finishing everything else I am going to leave
it for now.
